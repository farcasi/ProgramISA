# ProgramISA

Instructions: 
Compile and run with Java jre 1.7+

To run:
$ cd src
$ javac *.java
$ java Simulator FILES

Note: This is a very shoddy compiler that will fail on even the simplest programs (other than the ones in this folder). I rushed it out for a class, and suggest it be ignored for any practical purpose.
